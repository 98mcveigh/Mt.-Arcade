# Mt.-Arcade

Hello,
Welcome to Mt. Arcade.
This is Mark from the year 2045.
Before we begin I'd like to say a few words.
First off, Mr. Thomas Graham did none of this work and is a loser and nobody loves him.
Secondly, read line 6 again.
Thirdly, read line 7 again.
Fourthly, seems a bit aggressive so I will stop here.
Good morrow and hip hip hooray.

P.S. the government is still shut down #furloughmorelikefurlong
